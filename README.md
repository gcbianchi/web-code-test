### Instructions

Using the public Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2), we want to retrieve pokemon and list them (name and image) in groups.

- since there's lots of Pokemon out there, we want to only retrieve the first 10 Pokemon (first page) then have the ability to get more Pokemon (subsequent pages) by clicking a button

- since having all Pokemon in a flat list is not that exciting we want to have them grouped based on their height or types (since Pokemon can have multiple types they would appear in multiple groups).

- additionally we want the ability to toggle between the two grouping criteria by clicking a button
